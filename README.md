# RandomColorGenerator
In this example we will create an iOS App that will display a random color when a button is pressed.

In this project we go over:

- Swift 3 Syntax
- Array & Dictionary declaration
- Closures
- Event driven programming (Event listeners and handlers)
- Optionals
- Casting
- Auto Layout constraints
